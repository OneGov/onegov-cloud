~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  [href]

- The development server no longer watches all subdirectories.

  It just watches the current directory (without recursion) and the src
  directory (with recursion). This makes the detection quite a bit faster at
  the cost of having to manually restart when something inside another folder
  changes (e.g in the parts/omelette folder).

0.3.0 (2016-01-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Replaces dashes with underscores in namespaces and application ids.

  This change ensures that combined application_ids can be used more readily
  to create database schemas (only the '/' needs to be replaced).

  It also makes it easier to route a subdomin directly to an application_id.
  Before there was a mismatch between the subdomain (with dashes) and the
  application_id (may or may not have dashes). Now the subdomain with dashes
  is transformed into an application_id without dashes - the new canonical
  form.
