""" OneGov Ballot models the aggregated results of Swiss ballots.
It takes hints from the CH-0155 Standard.

See:

`eCH-0155: Datenstandard politische Rechte \
<http://www.ech.ch/vechweb/page?p=dossier&documentNumber=eCH-0155>`_

As of this writing onegov.ballot only aims to implement votes, not elections.
