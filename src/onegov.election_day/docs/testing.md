# Testing a new release

Before each new big release, the tests described in this document should be run. Alternatively, only the relevant tests (i.e. the scenarios which appear on the next election day) should be run before each election day.

## 1) Automated Tests

### 1.1 Unit-Tests

The unit tests are run automatically after every commit using [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/OneGov/onegov.election_day).

### 1.2 Crawler

There is a [crawler](https://github.com/msom/crawler.elections) available which allows to fetch all subpages of all known instances; run:

```
./run.py production
./run.py test
```

## 2) Manual Tests

It's important to test the code manually, to see visual flaws etc. One can use this checklist as an orientation what to check:

- [ ] Localization of the page
      - [ ] Does the localization work, i.e. can you switch the languages?
      - [ ] Does it look like everything is translated (especially in the front-end)?
- [ ] Do the overview views look OK?
      - [ ] The front page
      - [ ] The archive pages
      - [ ] Does the sorting work?
      - [ ] The page of an individual date
      - [ ] The JSON views (`json` and `summary`)
      - [ ] The data exports
- [ ] Does the backend looks OK?
      - [ ] Does the login and logout work?
      - [ ] Does the pagination work?
      - [ ] Can you create elections and votes?
      - [ ] Can you edit elections and votes?
      - [ ] Can you delete elections and votes?
      - [ ] Does the sorting work?
- [ ] Does the (SMS) notification work?
- [ ] Do the (font end) views look OK on a mobile?
- [ ] Are linked communal and cantonal instances working?
      - [ ] Do the results get copied to the other instances?
      - [ ] Do the links link to the full view on the other instance?
      - [ ] Are the communal results shown instead of the cantonal total on the communal instance?
- [ ] Do the upload of results work?
      - [ ] Typcial scenarios for uploading vote results
            - [ ] Upload a simple cantonal vote on a cantonal instance by using the standard format as described in the docs (VS, DC, IC, FS), e.g. for **GR**
                  - [ ] Check the empty vote results (RN)
                  - [ ] Upload temporary results (RT)
                  - [ ] Upload the completed results (RF)
            - [ ] Upload a complex cantonal vote on a cantonal instance by using the standard format as described in the docs (VC, DC, IC, FS), e.g. for **ZG**
                  - [ ] Check the empty vote results (RN)
                  - [ ] Upload temporary results (RT)

                  - [ ] *ToDo: Add templates for RT and RF*
            - [ ] Does a round trip produce the same results?
