# Testing a new release

Before each new big release, the tests described in this document should be run. Alternatively, only the relevant tests (i.e. the scenarios which appear on the next election day) should be run before each election day.

## 1) Automated Tests

### 1.1 Unit-Tests

The unit tests are run automatically after every commit using [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/OneGov/onegov.election_day).

### 1.2 Crawler

There is a [crawler](https://github.com/msom/crawler.elections) available which allows to fetch all subpages of all known instances; run:

```
./run.py production
./run.py test
```

## 2) POST-Upload

Results can be uploaded using a POST request and the format of the WabstiCExport program.


```
curl http://.../upload-wabsti-vote
	--user :[token]
	--form "sg_gemeinden=@SG_Gemeinden.csv"

curl http://.../upload-wabsti-majorz
	--user :[token]
	--form "sg_gemeinden=@SG_Gemeinden.csv"
	--form "wmstatic_gemeinden=@WMStatic_Gemeinden.csv"
	--form "wm_gemeinden=@WM_Gemeinden.csv"
	--form "wm_kandidaten=@WM_Kandidaten.csv"
	--form "wm_kandidatengde=@WM_KandidatenGde.csv"
```

## 3) Manual Tests

It's important to test the code manually, to see visual flaws etc. One can use this checklist as an orientation what to check:

- [ ] Localization of the page
      - [ ] Does the localization work, i.e. can you switch the languages?
      - [ ] Does it look like everything is translated (especially in the front-end)?
