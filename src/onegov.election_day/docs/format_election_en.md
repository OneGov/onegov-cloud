# Format Specification Elections

As file formats, CSV, XLS or XLSX files are accepted, which are generated by the electoral programs "elections (SESAM)" and "Wabsti elections and votes (VRSG)", or by the web application itself. If a table is to be created by hand, then the format of the web application is the easiest.

"Municipality" might refer to a district, ward, etc.

### Template

[election_sesam_proporz.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OneGov/onegov.election_day/master/docs/templates/election_sesam_proporz.csv)

## Wabsti Majorz

The file format needs two individual charts: the data export and the list of elected candidates.

### Columns data export

In the data export, there is a row for each municipality, candidates are arranged in columns. The following columns will be evaluated and should exist:

Name|Description
---|---
`AnzMandate`|
`BFS`|The municipality number (BFS number) at the time of the election. A value of `0` can be used for expats.
`EinheitBez`|
`StimmBer`|
`StimmAbgegeben`|
`StimmLeer`|
`StimmUngueltig`|
`StimmGueltig`|

As well as for each candidate:

Name|Description
---|---
`KandID_{XX}`|
`KandName_{XX}`|
`KandVorname_{XX}`|
`Stimmen_{XX}`|

Additionally the empty and invalid votes as well as candidates will be captured by the following candidate names:

- `KandName_{XX} = 'Leere Zeilen'**` (Empty votes)
- `KandName_{XX} = 'Ungültige Stimmen'**` (Invalid votes)

### Columns candidate results

Because the file format does not supply any information on the elected candidate, those must be included in a second column. Each row consists of one elected candidate with the following columns:

Name|Description
---|---
`ID`|ID of the candidate (`KandID_{XX}`).
`Name`|The surname of the candidate.
`Vorname`|The first name of the candidate.

### Temporary results

The file format does not contain any clear information on whether the overall election is completely counted. This information must be given directly on the form for the data upload.

The file format also does not contain any information on whether an individual municipality is completely counted. Therefore, as long as the entire election is not completed, no progress notification will be shown for Wabsti. If municipalities are missing entirely in the results, they are considered not yet counted.

## Wabsti Proporz

The file format needs four individual charts: the data export of the results, the data export of the statistics, the list connections and the list elected candidates.

### Columns data export of the results

There is a line per candidate and municipality in the data export. The following columns will be evaluated and should exist:

Name|Description
---|---
`Einheit_BFS`|The municipality number (BFS number) at the time of the election. A value of `0` can be used for expats.
`Einheit_Name`|
`Kand_Nachname`|

#### Panachage results

The results may contain panachage results by adding one column per list:

Name|Description
---|---
`{List ID}.{List code}`|The number of votes the list got from the list with the given `Liste_ID`. A `Liste_ID` with the value `99` (`99.WoP`) marks the votes from the blank list.

### Columns data export of the statistic

### Columns list connections

The file with list connections should contain the following columns:

Name|Description

Name|Description
---|---
`ID`|ID of the candidate (`Liste_KandID`).
`Name`|The surname of the candidate.
`Vorname`|The first name of the candidate.

### Temporary results

Therefore, as long as the entire election is not completed, no progress notification will be shown for Wabsti. If municipalities are missing entirely in the results, they are considered not yet counted.
