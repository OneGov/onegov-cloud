# The below diagram depicts the operations performed while sending a message.
# This sequence of operations will be performed for each file in the maildir
# on which ``send_message`` is called.
#
# Any error conditions not depected on the diagram will provoke the catch-all
# exception logging of the ``send_message`` method.
#
# In the diagram the "message file" is the file in the maildir's "cur"
# directory that contains the message and "tmp file" is a hard link to the
# message file created in the maildir's "tmp" directory.
