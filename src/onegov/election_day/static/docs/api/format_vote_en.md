## Preface

### Entities

An entity is either a municipality (cantonal instances, communal instances without quarters) or a quarter (communal instances with quarters).


## Formats


### OneGov

The format used by the web application for the export consists of one single file per vote. There is a line for every municipality and type of referendum (proposal, counter-proposal, tie-breaker).

#### Columns

The following columns will be evaluated and should exist at the least:

Name|Description
---|---
`status`|`unknown`, `interim` or `final`.
`type`|`proposal`, `counter-proposal` or `tie-breaker`.
`entity_id`|The municipality number (BFS number). A value of `0` can be used for expats.
`counted`|`true` if the municipality has been counted.
`yeas`|The number of “yes” votes.
`nays`|The number of “no” votes.
`invalid`|The number of spoilt votes.
`empty`|The number of blank votes.
`eligible_voters`|The number of persons eligible to vote.
`expats`|Number of expats. Optional.

#### Temporary results

Municipalities are deemed not to have been counted yet if one of the following two conditions apply:
- `counted = false`
- the municipality is not included in the results

If the status is
- `interim`, the whole vote is considered not yet completed
- `final`, the whole vote is considered completed
- `unknown`, the whole vote is considered completed, if all (expected) municipalities are counted
