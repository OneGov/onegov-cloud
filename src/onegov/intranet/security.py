    Applications building on onegov.core may add more roles and permissions,

    **editor**
        Has access to most things

    **member**
        Has access their own data. Be careful though, core doesn't know about
        personal data, so this is just a role to implement registered users.
        As with all permissions, making sure the right information is shown
        is up to the applications.
