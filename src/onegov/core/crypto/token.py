def random_token(nbytes: int = 512) -> str:
    """ Generates an unguessable token. Generates a random string with
    the given number of bytes (may not be lower than 512) and hashes
    the result to get a token with a consistent length of 64.

    Why hashing?

    We could of course just create a random token with a length of 64, but that
    would leak the random numbers we actually create. This can be a bit of
    a problem if the random generator you use turns out to have some
    vulnerability. By hashing a larger number we hide the result of our random
    generator.

    Doesn't generating a hash from a larger number limit the number of tokens?

    Yes it does. The number of different tokens is 2^256 after hashing,
    which is a number larger than all the atoms on earth (approx. 2^166).
    So there is a chance of a collision occuring, but it is *very* unlikely
    to *ever* happen.
