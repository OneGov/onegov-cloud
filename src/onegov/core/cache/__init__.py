""" Provides caching methods for onegov.core.

Onegov.core uses dogpile for caching:
`<https://dogpilecache.readthedocs.org/>`_

Unlike dogpile onegov.core does not provide a global region however.
The cache is available through the app::

    request.app.cache.set('key', 'value')

Global caches in a multi-tennant application are a security vulnerability
waiting to be discovered. Therefore we do not do that!

This means that this won't be available::

    from x import cache
    @cache.cache_on_arguments()
    def my_function():
        return 'foobar'

Syntactic sugar like this will be provided through decorators inside this
module in the future. For example, we could write one that is usable
on all morepath views::

    @App.view(...)
    @cache.view()
    def my_view():
        return '<html>...'

But no such method exists yet.

Currently there is one cache per app that never expires (though values will
eventually be discarded by redis if the cache is full).
