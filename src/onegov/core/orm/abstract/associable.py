""" Generic associations are an interesting SQLAlchemy design pattern
that allow for collections of records to be attached to other models by
mere inheritance.

Generic associations are useful in situations where a model should be
attachable to a number of third-party models. For example, we might say that
a comment model should be attacheable to any other model (say a page or a
ticket). In such an instance generic associations offer the benefit of
being simple to integrate on the third-party model.

Additionally we can define generic methods that work on all third-party
models that inherit from the associated model (in our example imagine a
"Commentable" class that leads to the automatic attachment of comments to
Page/Ticket models).

See also:
https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/blob/master/examples/
generic_associations/table_per_association.py

Note that you do not want to use these associations in lieue of simple
relationships between two models. The standard way of doing this leads to a
strong relationship on the database and is easier to change and reason about.

Generic associations are meant for generic usecases. These currently include
payments (any model may be payable) and files (any model may have files
attached). Other generic associations should be introduced along these
lines.

A single model may be associated to any number of other models. For example::

                            ┌─────────────┐
                      ┌─────│ Reservation │
    ┌────────────┐    │     └─────────────┘
    │  Payment   │◀───┤
    └────────────┘    │     ┌─────────────┐
                      └─────│    Form     │
                            └─────────────┘

Here, ``Payment`` is associable (through the ``Payable`` mixin).
``Reservation`` and ``Form`` in turn inherit from ``Payable``.

This all is probably best understood in an example:

        class Payment(Base, Associable):
            __tablename__ == 'payments'

        class Payable:
            payment = associated(Payment, 'payment', 'one-to-one')

        class Product(Base, Payable):
            __tablename__ == 'products'

This results in a product model which has a payment attribute attached to it.
The payments are stored in the ``payments`` table, products in the ``products``
table. The link between the two is established in the automatically created
``payments_for_products`` table.
