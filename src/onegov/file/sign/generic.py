        Arguments
        =========

        If the input-file exists on disk, its ``file.name`` attribute points
        to an existing path.

        Sublcasses may add extra parameters to this signing function, though
        it is expected that they all have a default value set.

        So it is okay to do this::

            def sign(self, infile, outfile, foo)

            def sign(self, infile, outfile, foo='bar')

        Return Value
        ============

        The sign function *must* return a unique request id for each signed
        file. This function should be composed of the service name and a
        unique identifier. For example: 'my_service/0b86854'. Using this
        identifier it should be possible to query the signing service backend
        for more information (in case we ever need to investigate).

        It is up to the signing service to know what should be part of this
        unique identifer. The only thing that can't be part of the identifer
        are secrets.
