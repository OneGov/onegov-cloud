    onegov.ticket is meant to be a rather generic bucket of tickets, to which
    varying modules submit tickets with varying content and different
    actionables.

    Each module wanting to submit tickets needs to implement a handler with
    a unique id and a unique short code. The short code is added in front of
    the ticket number.

    Tickets submitted to the database are shown in a list, without handler
    involvement. When a ticket is displayed, the handler is called with
    whatever data the handler supplied during ticket submission.

    The handler then uses the handler data to access whatever data it needs
    to display a summary as well as links to certain actions (possibly a link
    to the original item, links that change the state of the ticket as well
    as the data associated with the handler, etc.).
