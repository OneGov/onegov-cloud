""" Security mechansism when working with WebSockets.

There are a some risks involved when it comes to WebSockets as they behave
different than HTTP.

Same-Origin Policy (SOP)
------------------------

WebSockets are not protected through the Same-Origin Policy (SOP). That means,
origins that are not our domain can connect to the WebSocket too. If a user is
tricked to visit a attacker-controlled website, the page can establish a
websocket connection to us, on behalf of the user - if we rely solely on the
session ID. Altough the attacker can not access the cookie that contains the
session ID, the browser will happily sent it to the websocket server, creating
a connection that is now controlled by the attacker. See [2] and [3] for
examples.

To prevent that we can:

    (a) check the origin against a list of allowed origins. The user's
    browser controls the origin and can not be overwritten by the attacker
    (when in the context of the user's browser, it can however easily be
    spoofed when using a tool such as curl).

    (b) issue a one-time token that is not guessable for an attacker -
    similar to a CSRF token. The token is issued before initiating a
    WebSocket connection and must be presented when creating the WebSocket
    connection.

Authentication
--------------

By default, WebSockets are not authenticated and any connection must - if
required - be manually be authenticated. See [1] for a list of options.
