    :score_function:
        A function accepting a booking and returning a score. Occasions prefer
        bookings with a higher score over bookings with a lower score, if and
        only if the occasion is not yet full.

        The score function is meant to return a constant value for each
        booking during the run of the algorithm. If this is not the case,
        the algorithm might not halt.

    :validity_check:
        Ensures that the algorithm doesn't lead to any overlapping bookings.
        Runs in O(b) time, where b is the number of bookings per period.

    :stability_check:
        Ensures that the result does not contain any blocking pairs, that is
        it checks that the result is stable. This runs in O(b^3) time, so
        do not run this in production (it's more of a testing tool).

    :hard_budget:
        Makes sure that the algorithm halts eventually by raising an exception
        if the runtime budget of O(a*b) is reached (number of attendees
        times the number of bookings).

        Feel free to proof that this can't happen and then remove the check ;)

    :default_limit:
        The maximum number of bookings which should be accepted for each
        attendee.

    :attendee_limits:
        The maximum number of bookings which should be accepted for each
        attendee. Keyed by the attendee id, this dictionary contains
        per-attendee limits. Those fall back to the default_limit.

    :minutes_between:
        The minutes between each booking that should be considered
        transfer-time. That is the time it takes to get from one booking
        to another. Basically acts as a suffix to each booking, extending
        it's end time by n minutes.

    :alignment:
        Align the date range to the given value. Currently only 'day' is
        supported. When an alignment is active, all bookings are internally
        stretched to at least cover the alignment.

        For example, if 'day' is given, a booking that lasts 4 hours is
        considered to last the whole day and it will block out bookings
        on the same day.

        Note that the ``minutes_between`` parameter is independent of this.
        That is if there's 90 minutes between bookigns and the bookings are
        aligned to the day, there can only be a booking every other day::

            10:00 - 19:00 becomes 00:00 - 24:00 + 90mins.
