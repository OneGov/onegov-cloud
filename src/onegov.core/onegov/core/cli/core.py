Core Commands
-------------

Provides a framework for cli commands run against one ore more onegov
cloud applications.

OneGov cli commands are usually ran against a onegov.yml config file, which
may contain definitions for multiple applications. It may define multiple
application with different applicaiton classes and it may contain wildcard
applications which run the same application class, but contain multiple
tennants for each application.

To have a command run against one or many applications we use a selector to
help select the applications we want to target in a command.

In addition to selectors, onegov core cli commands provide a simple way to
write a function that takes a request and an application. This function is
then called for each application matching the selector, with a proper
request and application context already setup (with the same characteristics
as if called through an url in the browser).

Selector
--------

A selector has the form <namespace>/<id>.

That is, it consists of the namespace of the application and it's id.

For example:

    * ``/foo/bar``
    * ``/onegov_election_day/gr``
    * ``/onegov_town/govikon``

To select non-wildcard applications we can just omit the id:

    * ``/foo``
    * ``/onegov_onboarding``

Finally, to select multiple applications we can use wildcards:

    * ``/foo/*``
    * ``/onegov_election_day/*``
    * ``/*/g??``

Execution
---------

To run a supported command we provide a selector as an option::

    bin/onegov-core --select '/foo/*' subcommand

To find out what kind of selectors are available, we can simply run::

    bin/onegov-core

Which will print out a list of selector suggestions.

Registering a Selector Based Command
------------------------------------

To write a selector based command we first create a command group::

    from onegov.core.cli import command_group
    cli = command_group()

Using that command group, we can register our own commands::

    @cli.command()
    def my_click_command():
        pass

This command works like any other click command::

    import click

    @cli.command()
    @click.option('--option')
    def my_click_command(option):
        pass

Each command has the ability to influence the way selectors work. For example,
a command which creates the path that matches the selector we can use::

    @cli.command(context_settings={'creates_path': True})

By default we expect that a selector is passed. For commands which usually run
against all applications we can provide a default selector::

    @cli.command(context_settings={'default_selector': '*'})

Using the app/request context
-----------------------------

For a lot of commands the easiest approach is to have a function which is
called for each application with a request. This allows us to write commands
which behave like they were written in a view.

To do that we register a command which returns a function with the following
signature::

    def handle_command(request, app):
        pass

For example::

    @cli.command()
    def my_click_command():

        def handle_command(request, app):
            pass

        return handle_command

Setup like this, ``handle_command`` will be called with a request for each
application (and tennant). This function acts exactly like a view. Most
importantly, it does *not* require transaction commits, because like with
ordinary requests, the transaction is automatically committed if no error
occurs.

Using the app configurations directly
-------------------------------------

Sometimes we don't want to use the request/app context, or maybe we want to
setup something before receiving a request.

To do this, we use the ``pass_group_context`` decorator.

For example::

    from onegov.core.cli import pass_group_context

    @cli.command()
    @pass_group_context
    def my_click_command(group_context):

        for appcfg in group_context.appcfgs:
            # do something

This is independent of the app/request context. If we return a function, the
function is going to be called with the request and the app. If we do not, the
command ends as expected.

Returning multiple functions
----------------------------

When a cli command returns multiple functions, they are run in succession.

The signature is taken into account. If there's a 'request' parameter in the
function, the usual request context is set up.

If there is no 'request' parameter in the function, it is called once per
appcfg, together with the group context::

    @cli.command()
    def my_special_command():

        def handle_command(request, app):
            pass

        def handle_raw(group_context, appcfg):
            pass

        return (handle_command, handle_raw)

Limiting Selectors to a Single Instance
---------------------------------------

Sometimes we want to write commands which only run against a single
application. A good example is a command which returns 1/0 depending on the
existence of something *in* an application.

To do that, we use::

    @cli.command(context_settings={'singular': True})
    def my_click_command():
        pass

If a selector is passed which matches more than one application, the command
is not executed.
