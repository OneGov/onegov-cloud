""" Static files in OneGov applications are served under ``/static``.

By default the ``/static`` folder of the application is used, relative to
the path of the application class. Files in that folder are available to
everyone if enabled::

    from onegov.core.framework import Framework

    class App(Framework):
        serve_static_files = True

By default, the ``/static`` path is registered, but returns 404s. This prevents
accidental serving of static files.

To change the path to be served have a look at
:meth:`onegov.core.framework.Framework.static_files`.

Note that this is not meant to serve css/javascript files, rather it's a way
to serve images, documents and other things that are really static.

Files served through this mechanism support the ``If-Modified-Since`` header.

If you need to serve something on another path you can::

    class Favicon(StaticFile):
        pass

    @App.path(model=Favicon, path='favicon.ico')
    def get_favicon(app, absorb):
        return StaticFile.from_application(app, 'favicon.ico')
