""" onegov.core provides very basic theming support with the following
features:

* Themes can be external to onegov.core
* Themes can be used by onegov.core applications
* Themes can be compiled and the result is shared between applications

Themes are not meant to be switched at runtime though, they are statically
defined by the applications. The idea is to have a way to share themes
between applications, not to have powerful skinning features where the user
can change the theme at any given time.

A theme is basically a CSS file. There is no way to define images/icons
and so on. The only way to do that is to include the image in the css
file (which is not *that* crazy of an idea anyway).

To write a theme, create a class providing the properties/methods of
:class:`Theme`.

To use a theme you need to define the following setting::

    @App.setting(section='core', name='theme')
    def get_theme():
        return Theme()

To override the options passed to a theme, override the following function
in your application class::

    class App(Framework):

        @property
        def theme_options(self):
            return {'background': 'red'}

To include the theme in your html, call the following function in your
template::

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="${request.theme_link}">

Note that for the theme to work you need to define a filestorage. See
:meth:`onegov.core.framework.Framework.configure_application`.

    A onegov theme is any kind of compiled or non-compiled css file. The core

    Some framework based themes might required the ability to serve

    needs to be manually included through webassets.
