class CSVFile(object):
    """ Provides access to a csv file.

    :param csvfile:
        The csv file to be accessed. Must be an open file (not a poth), opened
        in binary mode. For example::

            with open(path, 'rb') as f:
                csv = CSVFile(f)

    :param expected_headers:
        The expected headers if known. Expected headers are headers which
        *must* exist in the CSV file. There may be additional headers.

        If the headers are slightly misspelled, a matching algorithm tries to
        guess the correct header, without accidentally matching the wrong
        headers.

        See :func:`match_headers` for more information.

        If the no expected_headers are passed, no checks are done, but the
        headers are still available. Headers matching is useful if a user
        provides the CSV and it might be wrong.

        If it is impossible for misspellings to occurr, the expected headers
        don't have to be specified.

    :param dialect:
        The CSV dialect to expect. By default, the dialect will be guessed
        using Python's heuristic.

    :param encoding:
        The CSV encoding to expect. By default, the encoding will be guessed
        and will either be UTF-8 or CP1252.

    :param rename_duplicate_column_names:
        It is possible to rename duplicate column names to deal with super
        wacky files. If this option is set and a duplicate header is found,
        a suffix is appended to the column name rather than throwing a
        DuplicateColumnNamesError.

    :param rowtype:
        An alternative rowtype for the resulting rows. This should be a
        callable that receives a `rownumber` key/value and all the other
        keys/values found in the csv. The keys are normalized and are valid
        Python identifiers usable as attribute names.

        Defaults to a namedtuple created using the found headers.

    Once the csv file is open, the records can be acceessed as follows::

        with open(path, 'rb') as f:
            csv = CSVFile(f)

            for line in csv.lines:
                csv.my_field  # access the column with the 'my_field' header
