    be defined outside classes (except for testing) - that is in the root of
    the module (directly in onegov/form/upgrades.py for example).

    Each upgrade task has the following properties:

    :name:
        The name of the task in readable English. Do not change the name of
        the task once you pushed your changes. This name is used as an id!

    :always_run:
        By default, tasks are run once on if they haven't been run yet, or if
        the module was not yet under upgrade control (it just added itself
        through the entry_points mechanism).

        There are times where this is not wanted.

        If you enable upgrades in your module and you plan to run an upgrade
        task in the same release, then you need to 'always_run' and detect
        yourself if you need to do any changes.

        If you need to enable upgrades and run a task at the same time which
        can only be run once and is impossible to make idempotent, then you
        need to make two releases. One that enables upgade control and a second
        one that

        Also, if you want to run an upgrade task every time you upgrade (for
        example, for maintenance), then you should also use it.

        The easiest way to use upgrade control is to enable it from the first
        release on.

        Another way to tackle this is to write update methods idempotent as
        often as possible and to always run them.

    :requires:
        A reference to another projects upgrade task that should be run first.

        For example::

            requires='onegov.form:Add new form field'

        If the reference cannot be found, the upgrade fails.
