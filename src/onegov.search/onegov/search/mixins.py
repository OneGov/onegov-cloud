    **Polymorphic Identities**

    If SQLAlchemy's Polymorphic Identities are used, each identity must
    have it's own unqiue ``es_type_name``. Though such models may share
    the ``es_properties`` from the base class, we don't assume anything and
    store each polymorphic identity in its own index.

    From the point of view of elasticsearch, each different polymorphic
    identity is a completely different model.

        a ``to_dict`` method.

        Internally, onegov.search stores differing languages in different
        indices. It does this automatically through langauge detection, or
        by manually specifying a language.

        Note that objects with multiple languages are not supported
        (each object is supposed to have exactly one language).

        Onegov.search will automatically insert the right analyzer for
        types like these.

        There's currently only limited support for properties here, namely
        objects and nested mappings do not work! This is going to be added
        in the future though.
