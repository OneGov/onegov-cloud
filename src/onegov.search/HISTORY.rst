1.3.0 (2018-03-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improves the handling of elasticsearch outages.

  Now, whenver elasticsearch is offline, a SearchOfflineError is raised. During
  subsequent method calls to the elasticsearch client reconnects are only
  attempted after increasingly longer timeouts (up to 5 minutes).

  This ensures that an elasticsearch outage doesn't slow down the rest of the
  application as it attempts to reconnect to the server.

0.6.0 (2016-03-22)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Uses a simpler analyzer for autocompletion.

  This change leads to the autocompletion working more literally. That is if
  we enter 'A1', we will find 'A1' and 'A11' but not 'A'. Before, all numbers
  were stripped from the autocompletion which is not what we want because
  we use autocompletion quite lierally (search for FRM-1234-5678 for example).

  [href]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Pin elasticsearch to 2.1 for now.

  With 2.2 it's no longer possible to support elasticsearch 1.0 and 2.0 with
  2.x. So we have to support either or.

  Currently we support Elasticsearch 1.x. Soon we'll upgrade to 2.x and use
  that exclusively.

  This release is therefore the last release that supports both 1.x and 2.x
  of elasticsearch.
