class Form(BaseForm):
    """ Extends wtforms.Form with useful methods and integrations needed in
    OneGov applications.

    **Fieldsets**

    This form supports fieldsets (which WTForms doesn't recognize). To put
    fields into a fieldset, add a fieldset attribute to the field during
    class definition::

        class MyForm(Form):
            first_name = StringField('First Name', fieldset='Name')
            last_name = StringField('Last Name', fieldset='Name')
            comment = StringField('Comment')

    A form created like this will have two fieldsets, one visible fieldset
    with the legend set to 'Name' and one invisible fieldset containing
    'comment'.

    Fieldsets with the same name are *not* automatically grouped together.
    Instead, fields are taken in the order they are defined and put into the
    same fieldset, if the previous fieldset has the same name.

    That is to say, in this example, we get three fieldsets::

        class MyForm(Form):
            a = StringField('A', fieldset='1')
            b = StringField('B', fieldset='2')
            c = StringField('C', fieldset='1')

    The first fieldset has the label '1' and it contains 'a'. The second
    fieldset has the label '2' and it contains 'b'. The third fieldset has
    the label '3' and it contains 'c'.

    This ensures that all fields are in either a visible or an invisible
    fieldset (see :meth:`Fieldset.is_visible`).

    **Dependencies**

    This form also supports dependencies. So field b may depend on field a, if
    field a has a certain value, field b is shown on the form (with some
    javascript) and its validators are actually executed. If field a does
    not have the required value, field b is hidden with javascript and its
    validators are not executed.

    The validators which are skipped are only the validators passed with the
    field, the validators on the field itself are still invoked (we can't
    skip them). However, only if the optional field is not empty. That is we
    prevent invalid values no matter what, but we allow for empty values if
    the dependent field does not have the required value.

    This sounds a lot more complicated than it is::

        class MyForm(Form):

            option = RadioField('Option', choices=[
                ('yes', 'Yes'),
                ('no', 'No'),
            ])
            only_if_no = StringField(
                label='Only Shown When No',
                validators=[InputRequired()],
                depends_on=('option', 'no')
            )

    **Pricing**

    Pricing is a way to attach prices to certain form fields. A total price
    is calcualted depending on the selections the user makes::

        class MyForm(Form):

            ticket_insurance = RadioField('Option', choices=[
                ('yes', 'Yes'),
                ('no', 'No')
            ], pricing={
                'yes': (10.0, 'CHF')
            })

            discount_code = TextField('Discount Code', pricing={
                'CAMPAIGN2017': (-5.0, 'CHF')
            })

    Note that the pricing has no implicit meaning. This is simply a way to
    attach prices and to get the total through the ``prices()`` and ``total()``
    calls. What you do with these prices is up to you.
