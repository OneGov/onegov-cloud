## Branches üññ

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that the master branch of this repository can and will be
> deployed often.
> It is therefore imperative *not* to develop on the master branch.

To create a new feature, start a new branch, named after the ticket:

* `ticket-101`
* `fer-50`
* `zw-112`

Or if there really is no ticket, with an appropriate name:

* `new-templating-engine`
* `experimental-design`

When ready to deploy, merge the branch as follows and provide a good commit
message (see below):

    git checkout master
    git pull
    git checkout ticket-101
    git rebase master
    git checkout master
    git merge ticket-101 --edit

### Commit Messages

Commit messages are used to build the release history. For a commit to show
up in the release history, it needs to be written as follows:

    <Module>: <Message>

    <Optional Description>

    TYPE: <Feature|Bugfix>
    LINK: <Ticket-Number>

For example:

    Election-Day: Adds an customizable footer

    The footer can be customized in the settings, by admin users.

    TYPE: Feature
    LINK: 101

Commits that do not follow this scheme are not included in the changelog.

**Module Name**

The module name may be any valid string that starts with an uppercase
character and is less than 17 characters long.

Examples:

* `Core`
* `Org`
* `Search`

**Type**

The type may be one of these values:

* `Feature`
* `Performance`
* `Bugfix`
* `Other`

**Link**

The link points to an issue, if there is any (optional). For example:

* `101` - points to GitHub Issue 101 in the `onegov-cloud` repository.
* `VOTES-1` - points to the first election day issue in the internal tracker.

To preview the changelog at any point, make your commit locally (with the
appropriate message) and run `do/changes`. This will render the complete
changelog in markdown. Your commit should be somewhere at the top.

If the commit you did does not show up, check to make sure that the module
name is valid (first character must be uppercase!).

## Installation ü§ò

To install OneGov Cloud, you should first get the source:

    git clone https://github.com/onegov/onegov-cloud

Switch to the source folder:

    cd onegov-cloud

Next you want to create a virtual environment:

    python -m venv venv

Then you want to activate it:

    source venv/bin/activate

Finally, run the installation:

    make install

## Configuration üëå

To configure your setup, copy the example configuration and adjust it to your needs:

    cp onegov.yml.example onegov.yml

Once you are happy, you can start your first organisation:

    onegov-org --select /onegov_org/govikon add "Gemeinde Govikon"

Together with your first user:

    onegov-user --select /onegov_org/govikon add admin admin@example.org

Then, start your local instance:

    onegov-server

And open the local url in your browser:

    open http://localhost/onegov_town/govikon

## Updates üôå

To run updates, you want to first update your sources:

    git pull

Then you should install updated dependencies:

    make update

Then, apply database changes.

    onegov-core upgrade

## Tests ü§û

To run all tests (this will take ~ 30 minutes):

    py.test

To run all tests concurrently with 2 processes (~ 15 minutes):

    pytest -n 2

To run the tests of a single module:

    py.test tests/onegov/core

To keep track of changes and only re-run necessary tests:

    py.test --testmon

## Translations üåç

To extract the translation strings of an already configured module:

    do/translate onegov.org

To add a language to module:

    do/translate onegov.org fr_CH

Additionally, you can use <https://gengo.com> to translate English messages
to other languages, like German, French or Italian.

For this to work, you need to set the following variables:

    export GENGO_PUBLIC_KEY="my gengo public key"
    export GENGO_PRIVATE_KEY="my gengo private key"

To push a translation job to Gengo, run:

    do/honyaku onegov.org fr_CH

Later you can re-run the command to get the state of the translations. As they
come in you can accept them or ask for revisions.

You can also add a comment for the translator when creating the job:

    do/honyaku onegov.org fr_CH "Please leave tickets as 'tickets', not 'billets'"

Or:

    do/honyaku onegov.org fr_CH "The following are variables and should be left as is: ${example}"


## Releases üöÄ

To create a new release, check the changelog first:

    do/changes

Then run the release script:

    do/release
