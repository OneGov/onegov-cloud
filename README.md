## Developing

To create a new feature or bugfix, start a new branch, named after the ticket:

* `ticket-101`
* `fer-50`
* `zw-112`

Or if there really is no ticket, with an appropriate name:

* `new-templating-engine`
* `experimental-design`

When ready to deploy, create a pull request with a good pull request message (see below) and, if possible, add some reviewers. If the review has passed, merge and **squash**.

### Commit and Pull Request Messages

**Commit messages** are used to build the release history. For a commit to show
up in the release history, it needs to be written as follows:

    <Module>: <Message>

    <Optional Description>

    TYPE: <Feature|Bugfix>
    LINK: <Ticket-Number>

For example:

    Election-Day: Adds an customizable footer

    The footer can be customized in the settings, by admin users.

    TYPE: Feature
    LINK: 101

Commits that do not follow this scheme are not included in the changelog.

**Pull request messages** should contain the first line of the commit message (`<Module>: <Message>`) for the title and the rest for the message.

**Module Name**

The module name may be any valid string that starts with an uppercase
character and is less than 17 characters long.

Examples:

* `Core`
* `Org`
* `Search`

**Type**

The type may be one of these values:

* `Feature`
* `Performance`
* `Bugfix`
* `Other`

**Link**

The link points to an issue, if there is any (optional). For example:

* `101` - points to GitHub Issue 101 in the `onegov-cloud` repository.
* `VOTES-1` - points to the first election day issue in the internal tracker.

To preview the changelog at any point, make your commit locally (with the
appropriate message) and run `do/changes`. This will render the complete
changelog in markdown. Your commit should be somewhere at the top.

If the commit you did does not show up, check to make sure that the module
name is valid (first character must be uppercase!).

## Requirements

To run OneGov Cloud locally, you must meet the following requirements:

* Linux/MacOS
* Postgres 12+
* Python 3.8+
* OpenJDK 11+
* Elasticsearch 7.x
* Redis 5.x
* NodeJS 9+

### Libraries

You'll additionally have to install a number of libraries, to build the
dependencies:

#### MacOS
```shell
brew install curl libffi libjpeg libpq libxml2 libxslt zlib libev poppler pv
```

#### Ubuntu
```shell
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libffi-dev libjpeg-dev libpq-dev
libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev libev-dev libgnutls28-dev libkrb5-dev
libpoppler-cpp-dev pv libzbar0 openssl libssl-dev
```

## Installation

To install OneGov Cloud, you should first get the source:

    git clone git@github.com:OneGov/onegov-cloud.git

Switch to the source folder:

    cd onegov-cloud

Next you want to create a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv venv

Then you want to activate it:

    source venv/bin/activate

Finally, run the installation:

    make install

> :sos: **I get compile errors related to OpenSSL on macOS**
>
> This occurs if you are using brew to install Python and OpenSSL. The resulting
> binaries link to the brew OpenSSL library, not the macOS one. To fix the
> problem, export the following variables before trying `make install` again:

```bash
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
```

## Configuration

To configure your setup, copy the example configuration and adjust it to your needs:

    cp onegov.yml.example onegov.yml

## Create a database for onegov

Define a user `dev` and password `devpassword` using `dsn: postgresql://dev:devpassword@localhost:5432/onegov`
in `onegov.yml`:

    sudo -u postgres psql

    CREATE USER dev WITH PASSWORD 'devpassword' LOGIN NOINHERIT;
    ALTER USER dev WITH SUPERUSER;
    CREATE DATABASE onegov;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE onegov TO dev;
    ALTER DATABASE onegov SET timezone TO 'UTC';

Onegov cloud uses one database for all applications and instances.

## Setting up the application(s)

**Org, Town, Town6, Agency, FSI and Translator Directory**

Create a new organisation in the database together with a new admin (adjust the path according to your configuration):

    onegov-org --select /onegov_org/govikon add "Gemeinde Govikon"
    onegov-user --select /onegov_org/govikon add admin admin@example.org --password test

**Election Day and Swissvotes**

Create the `principal.yaml` and flush redis. You may want to add a user (see above).

## Running the instance(s)

Run the server:

    onegov-server

And open the local url in your browser:

    open http://localhost/onegov_town/govikon

To auto-reload chameleon templates, set `ONEGOV_DEVELOPMENT` environment variable:

    export ONEGOV_DEVELOPMENT='1'

Run the elastic search cluster and the SMTP server:

    docker-compose up -d

## Updates

To run updates, you want to first update your sources:

    git pull

Then you should install updated dependencies:

    make update

Then, apply database changes.

    onegov-core upgrade

## Tests

### Python

To run all tests (this will take ~ 30 minutes):

    py.test

To run all tests concurrently with 2 processes (~ 15 minutes):

    pytest -n 2

To run the tests of a single module:

    py.test tests/onegov/core

To keep track of changes and only re-run necessary tests:

    py.test --testmon

To get an image with profiling information (requires graphviz):

    py.test --profile-svg

To use a RAM located database:

    docker run --rm \
      -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust \
      --mount type=tmpfs,destination=/var/lib/postgresql/data \
      -p 55432:5432 postgres:12.6 -c fsync=off
    pytest --nopg

### JavaScript

To run the javascript tests (swissvotes and election day):

    cd tests/js
    npm install
    npm test

To update the snapshots after changes, run:

    npm test -- --update-snapshot

## Translations

To extract the translation strings of an already configured module:

    do/translate onegov.org

To add a language to module:

    do/translate onegov.org fr_CH

To synchronize between different modules:

    do/apply-translations onegov.org onegov.town6

Additionally, you can use <https://gengo.com> to translate English messages
to other languages, like German, French or Italian.

For this to work, you need to set the following variables:

    export GENGO_PUBLIC_KEY="my gengo public key"
    export GENGO_PRIVATE_KEY="my gengo private key"

To push a translation job to Gengo, run:

    do/honyaku onegov.org fr_CH

Later you can re-run the command to get the state of the translations. As they
come in you can accept them or ask for revisions.

You can also add a comment for the translator when creating the job:

    do/honyaku onegov.org fr_CH "Please leave tickets as 'tickets', not 'billets'"

Or:

    do/honyaku onegov.org fr_CH "The following are variables and should be left as is: ${example}"


## Releases

To create a new release, check the changelog first:

    do/changes

Then run the release script:

    do/release
