Introduction
------------

OneGov Cloud is a RAD framework built with `Morepath, the web micro-framework
with superpowers <http://morepath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. It enables us
to write web applications for government agencies in a secure, efficient,
and modern manner.

OneGov Cloud has strong opinions about the technology it employs. This has the
following consequences:

 * It only runs on POSIX platforms.
 * It uses PostgreSQL 10+ and won't support other databases.
 * It requires Python 3.6+. Python 2.x is *not* supported.
 * It aims to provide concurrency through multiple processes and is not
   necessarily thread-safe.

Internationalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OneGov Cloud supports many languages and locales. That means that number- date-
and other formatting can use the appropriate locale. All static text is
translatable.

Content is translatable too, though OneGov Cloud doesn’t offer any tools for it
at this moment. This is generally a UI problem, not a framework problem.

URL paths are not translatable and should use English.

Development and documentation is in English. It’s what we are most comfortable
with when it comes to software development.
