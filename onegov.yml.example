# OneGov Cloud Example Configuration
# ----------------------------------

# The following block is shared with all applications below, though each
# application may override any or all values.
configuration: &global-config

  # OneGov only accepts requests with URLs matching the following expression,
  # in addition to localhost, which is always allowed.
  allowed_hosts_expression: '^[a-z0-9-\.]+.(dev|test|io)'

  # Additional exceptions to the host expressions can be listed one by one
  # here (those are not expressions, but full host names)
  # allowed_hosts:
  #   - example.org

  # The DSN to the postgres serve in use. The database has to exist and onegov
  # processes must have access. To create the db in the following example, you
  # can simply use 'createdb onegov' on a host with postgres installed.
  dsn: postgresql://localhost:5432/onegov

  # Set this to true for production deployments. It ensures that cookies are
  # only sent over a secure connection (TLS)
  identity_secure: false

  # The secrets with which cookie identities and CSRF tokens are created.
  #
  # If not given, a random secret will be created every time the host reboots.
  # Has to be different for each application and should be configured
  # explicitly on production systems.
  #
  # identity_secret: very-secret-key
  # csrf_secret: another-very-secret-key

  # OneGov knows two kinds of file storage. The first is called 'filestorage'
  # and it only supports very simple storage without links to the database.
  filestorage: fs.osfs.OSFS
  filestorage_options:
    root_path: '/usr/local/var/onegov/files'
    create: true
    dir_mode: 0755

  # The second kind of storage is depot, which is linked with the database
  # and is used more often and is the default for new deployments
  depot_backend: 'depot.io.local.LocalFileStorage'
  depot_storage_path: '/usr/local/var/onegov/depot'

  # Theme compilation is quick and in development it is possible to always
  # compile theme on every request.
  always_compile_theme: false

  # Some browsers send a special header when a user clicks on refresh while
  # holding down shift. The following setting will recompile themes whenever
  # that happens.
  allow_shift_f5_compile: false

  # OneGov keeps track of queries run against postgres and reports the
  # redundant ones when 'redundant' is selected. Other possible values are
  # 'all' and 'none', to either get a print of all queries or none.
  sql_query_report: redundant

  # If this is set to true, each request will create a cprofile in the
  # profiles folder. This slows down requests significantly.
  profile: false

  # Configures signing services (digital PDF signing), can be left out
  # signing_services: './signing-services'

  # Configures sentry tracebacks, usually only used in production or if
  # the sentry integration needs to be tested.

  # sentry_environment: testing
  # sentry_version: test

  # OneGov holds two sorts of mail. Transactional, non-spammy e-mail or
  # marketing e-mail. Though they can both have different configurations,
  # in development we usually use https://mailcatcher.me to look at
  # sent e-mails.
